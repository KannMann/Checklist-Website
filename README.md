# Checklist-Website
This is a Django based website template that allows non-technical users to run Python scripts conveniently by just clicking buttons. One use of this build is centralizing and automating various data cleaning steps.

Once the website is up and running (enter python manage.py runserver in command prompt to do so), outputs of the Python scripts are generated in the Output folder.
